## Intallation

For the installation of both Expo and React Native there is a need before the installation of **nodejs**, that it is a version higher than 14, since both frameworks are based on of it. The installation of nodejs changes depending on the operating system used, in our our case we used ubuntu, and we can install it with the following commands:

<br>

`sudo apt install nodejs`

<br>

Check the version of Node.js installed:

<br>

`nodejs -v`

<br>

Also we need NPM is a Package Manager for Node.js (Node Package Manager) needed to install modules and packages for use with Node.js.

<br>

`sudo apt install npm`

<br>

Check the version of NPM installed:

<br>

`npm -v`
